<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Court of Appeal recently handed down its judgment in Sheikh
Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber and MBI & Partners UK Limited v
Sheikh Walid Ibrahim Al Ibrahim and Sheikh Majid Bin Ibrahim Al
Ibrahim<sup>1</sup>, finding that the submission that an oral loan
agreement should have an implied term for interest because the
lender expected "some benefit" from the loan, was
unarguable and should be rejected.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>In December 2001, the Second Defendant spoke to the First
Claimant (Mr Al Jaber) by telephone and asked for a personal loan
of US$30 million. The purpose of the loan was to help progress a
business plan to create an Arabic language 24-hour satellite news
broadcasting service called Al-Arabiya. Mr Al Jaber orally agreed
to lend the Defendants the full amount, and subsequently had the
funds transferred. Nothing was said about whether the loan
agreement would bear interest. On 21 September 2015, a claim form
and particulars of claim were issued claiming repayment of the
principal sum, together with interest "at a reasonable
business rate".</p>

<h3>First instance</h3>

<p>Burton J considered that the Claimants were making two separate
claims; the first for US$30 million in debt and the second for
damages for breach of an implied term as to interest. Burton J
found that there was a good arguable case that there was a loan,
but not one that provided for interest. As such, while service out
of the jurisdiction against the Second Defendant was allowed (the
material application before the Judge was the Claimants'
application for permission to serve the Second Defendant out of the
jurisdiction), the Court would not permit service out of the
jurisdiction in respect of the claim for interest.</p>

<h3>Court of Appeal</h3>

<p>The Court of Appeal first considered Burton J's decision
that there were two divisible claims. In Elder v
Northcott<sup>2</sup>, the circumstances were that the principal
sum was time-barred and the claimant advanced a claim for interest
on the principal. Clauson J held that it would be
"paradoxical" for interest accruing before the time at
which the principal became barred to be recoverable when the
principal was not. Following that decision, the Court of Appeal
found that the claim for interest was "accessory" to the
claim for principal and those claims could not be separated or
"bifurcated".</p>

<p>The Court of Appeal then considered whether it was possible to
imply in a loan agreement a term for the payment of interest.
Citing Lord Neuberger's judgment in Marks & Spencer plc v
BNP Paribas Securities Services Co (Jersey) Ltd<sup>3</sup>, Simon
LJ stated that the question was whether there was a serious
question to be tried that the obligation to pay interest was either
"necessary to give business efficacy to the loan agreement or
such that the obligation would have been obvious to the parties,
although unstated, at the time the agreement was made".
Following an assessment of the factual background, the Court of
Appeal found that the loan could have operated in several ways to
the parties' mutual benefit without provision for interest, and
as such an implied term for interest was neither necessary to give
business effect to the agreement, nor so obvious that it "went
without saying".</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the overriding objective (namely that
cases are dealt with justly and at proportionate cost), the Court
of Appeal took the unusual step of determining the issue relating
to the obligation to pay interest. In doing so, it recognized that
the usual practice would have been for the second defendant to
apply for strike out and/or summary judgment, after the
jurisdictional issue had been resolved and an acknowledgment of
service had been filed. In finding for the Second Defendant, the
Court of Appeal considered that there was "no serious issue to
be tried as to the Claimants' claim for interest on the loan,
prior to demand, based on the existence of an implied
term".</p>

<h3>Further thoughts</h3>

<p>While it is always advisable that contracts are in writing, or
at the very least evidenced in writing, there will nevertheless
continue to be disputes over the implication of terms. This case
helpfully summarises the position per Lord Neuberger in Marks &
Spencer v BNP Paribas<sup>4</sup> that "the term that is to be
implied must either be necessary in order to give business effect
to the contract or it must be obvious in the sense that 'it
goes without saying'". Further, a claim for interest will
not be entertained where to claim for the principal is time-barred;
the common law is clear that a claim for interest is
"accessory" to a claim for principal and they will not be
treated as separate causes of action.</p>
