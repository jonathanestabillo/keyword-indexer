<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Following a relatively settled period, the Irish anti-money
laundering and counter terrorist-financing ("AML/CFT")
regime will shortly undergo significant reform in the shape of new
domestic legislation with a heavy emphasis on risk, revised
industry guidance and the establishment of central beneficial
ownership registers.</p>

<p>A significant aspect of these reforms is that certain industry
sectors will find themselves within the scope of AML/CFT
legislation for the first time and will be subject to direct
supervision for AML/CFT purposes by competent authorities. Affected
firms should start preparing for these changes now to ensure they
do not find themselves hurriedly introducing new systems, policies
and procedures without properly thinking through their overall
approach.</p>

<h3>Implementation of Energy the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive
("4MLD")</h3>

<p>4MLD was due to be transposed across Europe by June 2017. While
Ireland implemented certain elements of 4MLD in November 2016 by
introducing an obligation on incorporated entities to maintain
details of beneficial ownership, the bulk of 4MLD has still not
been implemented, and Ireland (along with Greece and Romania) has
been referred to the European Court of Justice as a result of its
inaction.</p>

<p>The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing)
(Amendment) Bill 2018 (the "AML Bill") which will amend
existing AML/CFT legislation and ultimately give effect to 4MLD was
introduced to the Dail in April 2018. The AML Bill passed all
stages in the Dáil prior to its summer recess and it is
expected that it will be enacted in October / November 2018.</p>

<h3>Key Features of the Bill</h3>

<h3>Certain "unregulated" financial institutions will be
required to register with Central Bank of Ireland</h3>

<p>Under existing AML/CFT legislation, certain financial
institutions are deemed to be designated as within scope of the
legislation (i.e. a "designated person") by virtue of the
activities they engage in and regardless of their authorisation
status. Such entities have been colloquially known as "Annex
1" or "Schedule 2" financial institutions, and
examples include SPV's involved in lending or financial
leasing. In the UK, equivalent entities have for a number of years
been subject to a registration and supervision regime administered
by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>

<p>To date, Annex 1 / Schedule 2 financial institutions in Ireland
have not been required to register with the Central Bank of Ireland
("CBI"), but the Bill imposes a registration requirement
and provides that the CBI will establish and maintain a register of
such entities. Failure to register will be a criminal offence. In
registering, an Annex 1 / Schedule 2 financial institution will be
required to specify the activities that make it a designated
person. The Bill envisages that the CBI may provide further detail
on the registration process in procedures.</p>

<p>Prior to registration, an Annex 1 / Schedule 2 financial
institution will need to develop and implement policies and
procedures in order to demonstrate an ability to comply with the
various AML/CFT obligations imposed on designated persons,
including risk assessment, upfront and ongoing customer due
diligence ("CDD"), training and reporting of suspicious
activity.</p>

<h3>Increased focus on risk assessment</h3>

<p>The Bill requires designated persons to conduct a documented
risk assessment of their business activities (a "business risk
assessment") taking into account certain specified risk
factors, the National Risk Assessment, any guidance on risk issued
by the relevant competent authority and any guidelines issued by
the European Supervisory Authorities. The business risk assessment
must be approved by senior management within the business and kept
up to date.</p>

<p>The Bill also prescribes certain factors to be taken into
account by designated persons when assessing the money laundering
and terrorist financing risks presented by customers and
transactions in order to determine the extent of CDD to be applied.
Notable higher risk factors include non-resident customers,
companies with nominee shareholders, non-face-to-face business
relationships, new products and new business practices, and the use
of new technologies for products.</p>

<h3>Changes to CDD requirements</h3>

<p>Designated persons will only be permitted to apply simplified
CDD in circumstances where the customer or transaction is
considered to be low risk. Having decided to apply simplified CDD,
the designated person must keep a record of its determinations in
relation to risk and the customer and / or transactions will have
to be monitored to detect unusual or suspicious activity.</p>

<p>Under existing AML/CFT legislation, it is permissible for banks
to open accounts for customers before verifying their identity
provided no transactions are carried out on the account
pre-verification. In a welcome development, this facility will be
extended to financial institutions.</p>

<p>The obligation to apply enhanced CDD to politically exposed
persons ("PEPs") will be extended to PEPs resident in
Ireland.</p>

<h3>Policies and procedures</h3>

<p>The Bill provides a detailed list of policies, procedures and
controls which must be adopted by a designated person. The Bill
also contains more prescriptive requirements in relation to
group-wide policies and procedures than those set out in existing
AML/CFT legislation.</p>

<h3>Reporting obligations</h3>

<p>The Bill requires designated persons to report any service or
transaction provided by the designated person that is connected
with a high-risk third country to the Financial Intelligence Unit
("FIU") of An Garda Síochána (the Irish
police force) and the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

<h3>Powers of competent authorities</h3>

<p>The Bill provides additional powers to competent authorities,
including powers to issue directions to a designated person or a
class of designated persons to:</p>

<ul>
<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">document its / their risk assessments
of customers and / or transactions;</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">appoint a member of senior management
with primary responsibility for the implementation and management
of AML measures;</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">appoint an individual at management
level to act as a compliance manager; and</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">undertake an independent, external
audit to test the effectiveness of its / their internal policies,
controls and procedures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Beneficial Ownership Registers</h3>

<p>One of the key elements of 4MLD is that Member States are
required to establish and maintain a central register of beneficial
ownership information of corporate and other legal entities. The
first step in this process was addressed with the introduction of
the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of
Corporate Entities) Regulations in November 2016 (S.I. 560/2016)
requiring incorporated entities to maintain an internal register of
beneficial owners. Further statutory instruments are expected
imminently to:</p>

<ul>
<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">impose equivalent obligations on
trusts and Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicles
("ICAV's") to maintain an internal register of
beneficial owners;</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">assign legal responsibility to the
relevant agencies for the establishment and maintenance of the
central registers of beneficial ownership; and</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">impose a reporting obligation on
incorporated entities, trusts and ICAV's to file returns to the
central registers. It is expected that there will be a reasonable
window of opportunity for obliged entities to commence
reporting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5MLD</h3>

<p>In response to terrorist attacks in Europe and the leak of the
Panama Papers, the European Commission published a proposal in July
2016 to amend 4MLD to include additional measures to tackle money
laundering and terrorist financing. The proposed measures included
the application of enhanced checks towards high risk third
countries, bringing virtual currency exchange platforms within
scope of the AML/CFT regime, lowering due diligence thresholds for
prepaid instruments, enhancing the powers of FIUs and giving FIUs
swift access to information on the holders of bank and payment
accounts, through centralised registers or electronic data
retrieval systems.</p>

<p>On 19 June 2018, the final text of 5MLD was published in the
Official Journal of the European Union and Member States will
therefore have until 10 January 2020 to fully implement the
directive.</p>

<p>From a corporate transparency perspective, the key feature of
5MLD is that it requires Member States to make central registers of
beneficial ownership accessible to the general public with the
exception of the register in respect of trusts, which will still
require demonstration of a legitimate interest.</p>

<h3>CBI Consultation on Guidance</h3>

<p>The industry guidelines (the "Guidelines") which were
published by the Department of Finance in February 2012 and which
the CBI has had regard to when assessing designated persons'
compliance with AML/CFT obligations are due to be revised later
this year. The CBI has informally indicated that it intends to
update the Guidelines in line with the AML Bill once enacted, and
it is likely that the CBI will also seek to incorporate elements of
the guidance provided in its ongoing series of AML/CFT bulletins.
The CBI may also incorporate references to the Risk Factor
Guidelines published by the European Supervisory Authorities which
came into effect on 26 June 2018.</p>

<h3>Gambling Sector</h3>

<p>4MLD brought all providers of gambling services within its remit
whereas under the previous directive, only casinos were covered.
However, 4MLD contained a provision allowing Member States to
exempt all or parts of their gambling industry from the scope of
the implementing legislation if they could be proven to be low
risk.</p>

<p>In March 2018, the Department of Finance published a risk
assessment of the Irish gambling sector which concluded that the
overall risk in the betting and online gambling sectors is
medium-low whereas the risk in respect of lotteries, bingo, poker
and gaming, and amusement arcades is considered to be low. The
report concluded that providers of gambling services in the
bookmaking and online sub-sectors should be classified as
designated persons for AML/CFT purposes. The likelihood is that
this will be achieved via a separate statutory instrument as
opposed to specific provisions being contained in the AML Bill.</p>

<h3>FATF Assessment of Ireland's AML/CFT System</h3>

<p>The Financial Action Task Force ("FATF") published its
report on Ireland's AML/CFT system in September 2017. The
report was generally positively received as FATF concluded that
Ireland has a sound and substantially effective regime to tackle
money laundering and terrorist financing. However, FATF did point
to a number of areas where improvements could be made and set out
over 70 recommendations in this regard. Ireland is due to report
back to FATF this month outlining how it intends to address each of
the issues raised by FATF and, if accepted by FATF, this will
likely serve as the blueprint for the development of Ireland's
AML/CFT regime in the coming years.</p>

<h3>New Anti-Corruption Legislation</h3>

<p>The Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 (the
"Anti-Corruption Act") came into effect on 30 July 2018.
The Anti-Corruption Act modernises and consolidates the law on
corruption and bribery in Ireland, and is one of the key measures
in the Government's strategy to tackle white collar crime.</p>

<p>The Anti-Corruption Act is broad in nature in that it
criminalises direct and indirect corruption in the public sector
and the private sector. Given its breadth, companies will need to
assess their exposure to the risk of corruption and determine how
best to address this risk. As a starting point, companies should
implement and / or update their anti-bribery policies and ensure
that compliance with the policies is monitored in practice, with
training to be provided to relevant people in the business.</p>
