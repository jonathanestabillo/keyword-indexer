<h3>1. Commencement of a Delegated Regulation</h3>

<p>On 10 April 2018 the European Commission adopted a
<em><strong>Regulation</strong></em> (the "Delegated
Regulation") amending and supplementing <em><strong>the MMF
Regulation</strong></em>. On 13 July 2018, the Delegated Regulation
was published in the Official Journal of the EU ("OJ")
and will enter into force on 2 August 2018. However, the Delegated
Regulation will apply to new and existing money market funds
("MMFs") from 21 July 2018 with the exception of Article
1 (which contains the amendment to the MMFR set out at (a) below)
which will apply from 1 January 2019.</p>

<p>The Delegated Regulation imposes additional requirements on
managers of MMFs where they are investing in certain categories of
assets, as follows:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;"><strong>Simple, transparent and
standardised ("STS") securitisations and asset-backed
commercial papers ("ABCPs")</strong><br />
<br />
Under the MMF Regulation, there is a specific incentive to invest
in STS securitisations and ABCPs. In this regard, the Delegated
Regulation simply amends the MMF Regulation to cross-refer to the
securitisation regime already set down in Regulation (EU) 2017/2402
(which set out a general framework for securitisation and created a
specific framework for STS securitisation).</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;"><strong>Assets received under a
Reverse Repurchase Agreement</strong><br />
<br />
The Delegated Regulation provides clarity on the specific
quantitative and qualitative requirements relating to assets
received under reverse repurchase agreements, which include:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">the assets shall be subject to
haircuts in accordance with the requirements set out under
Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (on prudential requirements for credit
institutions and investment firms);</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">Managers of MMFs ("MMF
Managers") are required to apply higher haircuts than the
minimum thresholds set out in Regulation (EU) 575/2013 where they
consider it necessary to ensure that the collateral received as
part of the reverse repurchase agreement is sufficiently liquid.
The Delegated Regulation prescribes a list of factors that MMF
Mangers must take account of when applying a higher haircut;</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">MMF Managers are required to put in
place a clear haircut policy adapted to each asset received as
collateral. The policy should be documented and should substantiate
each decision to apply a specific haircut to the value of an
asset;</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">MMF Managers should also monitor and
revise the amount of the haircut or the additional haircut taking
into account the residual maturity or other factors related to the
viability of the counterparty; and</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">The Delegated Regulation also
provides an exempted list of counterparties of which the above
requirements do not apply.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;"><strong>Credit Quality Assessment
Methodologies</strong><br />
<br />
In relation to credit quality assessments carried out by MMF
Managers, the Delegated Regulation requires the methodologies to
include:<br />
<br />
 

<ol type="i">
<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">criteria for validating the internal
credit quality assessment methodologies;</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">criteria for quantifying credit risk,
and the relative risk of default of the issuer and of the
instrument;</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">criteria for establishing qualitative
indicators in relation to the issuer of the instrument; and</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">criteria for establishing qualitative
credit risk indicators in relation to the issuer of the
instrument.</li>
</ol>

<br />
In addition, the Delegated Regulation provides that:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">MMF Managers may take investment
decisions that override the result of a credit quality assessment
only in exceptional circumstances (such as stressed market
conditions), where there is an objective reason for doing so and
provided such decisions are properly documented;</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">the credit quality assessment should
not be a once-off assessment, rather it should be carried out
continually and should be revised, in particular, when there is a
material change that could have an impact on the existing credit
quality assessment of the instrument (the Delegated Regulation also
defines the circumstances that give rise to a material change);
and</li>

<li style="LINE-HEIGHT:17px;">MMF Managers should take into account
a downgrading by a credit rating agency and should also carry out
their own assessment according to their internal credit quality
assessment methodology. MMF Managers are also required to establish
an internal procedure for selection of credit rating agencies
suited to the investment portfolio of the MMF.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>2. New Central Bank of Ireland Application forms for MMFs</h3>

<p>The Central Bank of Ireland (the "Central Bank") has
published its <em><strong>MMFR Application Forms</strong></em>. The
relevant application forms are applicable from 21 July 2018 and
will apply to all new funds seeking to be authorised as a MMF and
those existing funds transitioning under the MMF Regulation.</p>

<h3>Timing</h3>

<p>For all existing MMFs the transitioning deadline for compliance
with the MMF Regulation is 21 January 2019. However, the Central
Bank have announced that any transitioning MMFs that require prior
document review (i.e. UCITS and RAIFs) should file their updated
documents by 1 September 2018 to ensure that they are approved by
21 January 2019.</p>

<h3>3. European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) letter to
the European Commission in relation to share cancellation</h3>

<p>On 20 July 2018, ESMA published a
<em><strong>letter</strong></em> it had written to the European
Commission in relation to reverse distribution mechanism (RDM) or
share cancellation under the MMF Regulation.</p>

<p>The Letter responds to a January 2018 letter from the European
Commission in which it agreed with ESMA's analysis that the
practice of share cancellation is not compatible with the MMF
Regulation.</p>

<p>In its letter, ESMA calls on the Commission to make public the
text of an opinion of the Legal Service of the Commission on the
compatibility of share cancellation with the MMF Regulation given
that it appears the opinion has been shared with some market
participants, but not all. ESMA is of the view that the Commission
needs to make its interpretation clear to ensure a proper and
consistent interpretation and implementation of the MMF
Regulation.</p>

<h3>4. Central Bank Review of Dealing Practices</h3>

<p>For the last number of months the Central Bank has been liaising
with MMF managers and administrators, to gather information in
relation to the dealing practices used for Irish MMFs, in
particular focusing on the use of what is termed 'historic
pricing' in such MMFs. It is expected that the Central Bank
will clarify its position on the use of such dealing practices
shortly given any transitioning MMFs that require prior document
review by the Central Bank will need to file updated documents by 1
September 2018.</p>

<h3>5. Comment</h3>

<p>The publication and entry into force of the Delegated Regulation
is to be welcomed as it will provide clarity to MMF Managers in
relation to the quantitative and qualitative requirements that
apply to assets received under reverse repurchase agreements. In
addition, the obligations prescribed in relation to credit quality
assessment criteria will assist MMF Managers in drafting fund
policies as well as the disclosures in the MMF's offering and
constitutive documents.</p>

<p>The publication of the Central Bank application forms is also
helpful as it provides a suitable checklist for new and existing
funds under the MMF Regulation.</p>

<p>The ESMA letter is an important development as it should
encourage the Commission to provide its analysis and reasoning
behind its stance on RDM and its compatibility with the MMF
Regulation. Developments on this issue will continue to be closely
monitored by the industry as it is an extremely sensitive matter
for many MMF Managers particularly those managing constant NAV Euro
denominated MMFs.</p>
